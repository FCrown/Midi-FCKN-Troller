The MIDI FCKN-troller

by Francisco Coronado and Khoa Nguyen

 

Our goal is to create a virtual midi sample controller. This controller will allow users to import samples to individual sound pads and use them to create unique audio clips. A variety of combinations will be available with the use of looping along with click or press to play individual soundtracks.




Import and Capture Sounds

Each of the twenty-five colored sound pads will allow for a sound file input of choice, or some basic sound files will be pre-loaded into the FCKN-troller.

The onboard record button will provide a way to record live sessions.  Exporting audio clips will write a new sound file right onto your desktop.


Design and functionality

With a minimalistic grid design for the sound board, it will be easy to distinguish the sound pads from the other functional pads. The twenty-five colored sound pads will make up the lower left 5 x 5 portion of the grid. Upon clicking or pressing an assigned keyboard key, the pressed pad will change color to resemble a pressed button.

A single virtual display screen will provide information such as volume, looping tracks, power, file writes, and other critical information.

The volume will be controlled with simple up/down arrow pads. A dedicated mute button will toggle the volume between zero and the current volume.

The loop button, when pressed, will loop over the chosen tracks that are indicated by the track buttons along the right edge of the grid. Their lights will help illuminate the board in a complementary display with the sound pads.
